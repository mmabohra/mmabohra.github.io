## Mustafa Bohra 

Hello, I'm Mustafa Bohra.  
I have 2 years of experience with data and have been studying as a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer for 2 years, continuously learning and growing in the field.

I study consistently and document my learning on my blog.  
I read AI papers and occasionally summarize them here.  
I also participate in AI competitions from time to time to explore new domains.
